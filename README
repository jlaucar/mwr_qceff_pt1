This directory contains matlab scripts used to generate figures for
A Quantile Conserving Ensemble Filter Framework. Part I: Updating an Observed Variable
by Jeffrey Anderson
which was submitted to Monthly Weather Review.

There are three classes of scripts:

1. Quantile conserving filter increment scripts. These have names beginning with "obs_increment_" 
and compute the increments for an input prior ensemble given parameters describing the likelihood
for a variety of different continuous prior / likelihood pairs.

2. Figure generation scripts. These have names "paper_fig#" and each generates
one of the figures for the mansuscript.

3. Utilities: 
   a. norm_inv.m: Computes the inverse of the CDF (quantile function) for a standard normal.
   b. get_cdf_gaussians.m: Computes the cdf for a distribution that is the sum of n normals with
                           specified means and standard deviations.
   c. cdf_search_gaussians.m: Computes the inverse of the CDF (quantile function) for a distribution
                              that is the sum of n normals with specified means and standard deviations.
